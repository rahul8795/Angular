-What is framework?
    Framework works on the top of a language, which provides a built-in project model.
    Ex.      Angular        : JavaScript
             React          : JavaScript
             Spring         : JAVA
             ASP.NET MVC    : C#.Net
             Django         : Python
             etc.
 
    Framework acts as a mediator between "language" and developer.
     Developer  --> Angular  --> JavaScript

Framework Provide:
-------------------
@Component
class classname
{
    username;
    password;
    
    onLoginClick()
    {
       if(username==".." && password=="...")
       {
       }
       else
       {
       }
    }
}


Language Provide:
-----------------
class classname
{
   property;
    
   method()
   {
   }
}
