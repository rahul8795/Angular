1) What is Angular?
------------------

Front End Development Framework:
---------------------------------
Front-End development is all about the parts of a webiste that users see. Also refered to
as "CSS framework" these are packages containing pre-written, standardized code in files 
and folders. They give you a base to build on while still allowing flexibility with the 
final design. 

Maintained and Developed by Google:
-----------------------------------
Angular JS is a Javascript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by 
Google and by a community of individuals and conrporations to address many of the challenges
encountered in developing single-page applications.It aims to simplify both the development 
and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model-view-
controller(MVC) and model-view-viewmdoel(MVVC) architectures.

Javascript Based:
------------------
Javascript is the language of the web. If you know Javascript. You can talk to your browser
like it is your best friend. Angular is based on Javascript and Typescript (which is a 
superset of Javascript).

Single Page Application:
-------------------------
A single-page application is an app that works inside a browser and does not require page 
reloading use. You are using this typw of applicaitons every day. These are, for instance:
Gmail,Google Maps, Facebook or GitHub.


2) Angular 8: What's New:
--------------------------

IVY Engine:
-----------
Angular Ivy is a next-generation compilation and rendering pipeline, which reduces the 
bundle size, loads faster in slower networks and is simple to use. Ivy is still in an 
experimental phase and is expected to be available in Angular version 8.0.

BEZEL Engine:
-------------
Google open sourced the software responsible for building most of our projects under the 
name Bazel. Bazel is a powerful tool which can keep track of the dependecies between 
different packages and build targets. The coolest features of Bazel is that it has a smart
algorithm for determining the build dependecies.

Differential Loading:
---------------------
Differential loading is process by which the browser choose between modern or lagacy
Javascript based on its own capabilities. We now take advantage of this by default by
performing a modern bulid (es2015) and a lagacy build (es5) of your applicaiton. When
users load your applicatation, they'll automatically get the bundle they need.


3) Project Setup:
------------------
Download nodeJs and npm in our system

NodeJs - It is open-source, cross plateform and Javascript runtime environment that execute
javascript code outside the browser.

4) Writing Our FIrst App:
--------------------------


5) What is Typescript?
-----------------------
Typescript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language. It was designed by Anders
Hejlsberg at Microsoft. Typescript is a superset of Javascript.


6) Integrating External CSS:
-----------------------------
install bootstrap using bellow commond:
>>> npm i --save bootstrap@3
after that to "node_modules" where u will find 'bootstrap.css" file copy file path
then come to "angular.json" file and search 'style' where u put the path

after go to terminal and press  'ctrl+c'  and re-run the program using bellow commond:
>>> npm -o server

7) How an angular app gets loaded?
------------------------------------

8) Components:
---------------
Generating sub component using bellow comonds:

>>> ng generate component SubServer

9) Data Binding:
------------------

10) Event Binding:
-------------------

11) Directives:
----------------

12) Using Built In Directives:
---------------------------------
ngIf
ngFor
ngStyle
ngClass

performing a modern bulid (es2015) and a lagacy build (es5) of your applicaiton. When
users load your applicatation, they'll automatically get the bundle they need. 

8) What is String Interpolation?
---------------------------------



9) Explain Authentication and Authorization:
--------------------------------------------
Authentication:
----------------
The User login credentials are passed to an authentication API,
which is present on the server. Post server-side validation of 
the credentials, a JWT(JSON Web Token) is returned.The JWT has
information or attributes regarding the current user. The user 
is then identified with the given JWT. This is called 
authentication.

Authorization:
--------------
Post logging-in successfully, different users have a different 
lavel of access. While some may access everything, access for 
others might be restricted to only some resources. The level
of access is authorization.


10)Explain Scope Hirarchy in Angular:
--------------------------------------


11) How to generate a class using the CLI?
--------------------------------------------
>> ng generate class dummy

12)  What are templates in Angular:
-----------------------------------
Templates in Angular are written with HTML that contains Angular
specific elements and attributes. These templates are combined
with information coming from the model and controller which are 
further rendered to provide the dynamic view to the user.

13) What is the difference between an Annotation and a Decorator
in Angular?
------------------------------------------------------------------
Annotation:
-----------
Annotaions in angular are "only" metadata set of the class using 
the reflect metadata library. Ther are used to create an "annotation"
array.

Decorator:
----------
On the other hand, decorators are the design patterns that are used
for separating decoration or modification of a class without 
actually altering the original source code.

14) What is a directive in Angular?:
-------------------------------------
- Component Directives
- Structural Directives
- Attribute Directives


15) Explain the differents types of directives:
-----------------------------------------------
- Component Directives
- Structural Directives
- Attribute Directives

16) What is data binding and its different types?:
---------------------------------------------------
Data Binding:
--------------
- String Interpolation
- Property Binding
- Event Binding
- Two Way data binding

17) What are the differences between Angular and jQuery:
---------------------------------------------------------
    jQuery                        |       Angular
--------------------------------------------------------------
. Supports DOM Manipulation 	  | Supports DOM Manipulation		
. No Restful API		  | Supports Restful API
. Has Animaiton Support		  | Has Animaiton Support
. No deep linking Routing 	  | Supports deep linking Routing
. No form validation		  | Supports form validation
. No Two way data binding	  | Supports Two way data binding
. Support AJAX			  | Support AJAX
--------------------------------------------------------------------

18) What are the building blocks of angular?
---------------------------------------------
Thers are 9 building blocks of angular:
- Components
- Data Binding
- Dependency Injection
- Directives
- Metadata
- Modules
- Routing
- Services
- Template

19) Explain the differences between Angular Expression vs Javascript Expression:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Angular Exp                                          | Javascript Exp
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. They can contain literals operators and variables	| They can contain literals operators and variables	
. They can be witten inside the HTML tags		| They can not be witten inside the HTML tags
. They do not support conditionals, loops and exceptions| They do support conditionals, loops and exceptions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20) What is the difference between a service() and a factory()?
----------------------------------------------------------------
Service:
Used for the business layer of the application, the service() function
operates as a constructor function. The function is invoked at runtime
using the new keyword.

Factory:
Although the factory() function works in pretty much the same way
as the service() function does, the former is more flexible and 
powerful.In actual, the factory() function are design that help 
in creating objects.

21) What is AOT?
-----------------
AOT stands for Ahead-of-Time compiler. It is used for pre-compiling
the application components and along with their templates during 
the build process. Angular applications which are compiled with AOT
has a smaller launching time. Also, components of these applications
can execute immediately, without needing any client-side compiler.

22) What is Angular Material?
------------------------------
It is UI component library. Angular material helps in creating 
attractive, consistent, and fully functional web pages as well
as web applications. It does so while following modern web design
principles, including browser portability and graceful degradation.

23) Explain the digest cycle in Angular.
----------------------------------------

24) Explain the various types of filters in Angular.
----------------------------------------------------
- Currency
- Date
- Filter
- JSON
- limit
- Lowercase
- number
- orderby
- Template 
- Uppercase

25) What is ngOnInit()? How to define it?
-------------------------------------------

26) What is SPA (Single Page Application) in Angular?
    Contrast SPA technology with traditional web technology?
--------------------------------------------------------------
Features and Benifits of Quick Test Pro:
In the SPA technology, only a single page, which in index.HTML,
is maintained although the URL keeps on changing. Unlike the
traditional web tachnology. SPA technology is faster and easy
to develop as well.

In the conventional web technology, as soon as a client requests 
a webpage, the server sends the resource. However, when again the 
client requests for another page, the server responds again with 
sending the requested resource. The problem with this technology
is that it requires a lot of time.

27) What are the Angular Modules?
-----------------------------------


28) On which types of the component can we create a custom directive?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Angular Filters:
- Element
- Attribute
- CSS
- Comment

29) What are the angular animations:
-------------------------------------
Angular's animation system is built on CSS funtionality in order to 
animate any property that the browser considers animatable. These
properties includes positions, sizes, transforms, colors, borders etc.

30) Differentiate between one-way binding and two-way data binding?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In one-way data binding, the View or the UI part does not update
automatically whenever the data model changes. You need to manually
write custom in order to update it every time the view changes.

Two-way data binding, the View or the UI part is updated implicitly
as soon as the data model changes. It is a synchronization process
, unlike one-way data binding.

31) What are the lifecycle hooks for components and directives?
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Constructor
- ngOnChanges
- ngOnInit
- ngOnDestroy

32) What is the View Encapsulation and how many ways are there
do to do it in angular?
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Emulated
- Native
- None

33) Differentiate between DOM and BOM:
---------------------------------------
    DOM                                            |    BOM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Document Object Model 			   | Browser Object Model
. Represents Content of a Webpage 		   | Works a level above webpage to include browser attributes
. All the objects are arranged in a tree structure | All global Javascript Objects, variables and functions become
. Manipulates HTML Docs                            | -member of the window object
. W3C recommended standard specification	   | Access and manipulate browser window
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
34) What are template Expressions:
----------------------------------
A template expression produces a value similar to any Javascript
expression.Angular executes the expression and assigns it to a 
property of a binding target; the target might be an HTML element
, a component, or a directive. In the property binding , a template
expression appears in quotes to the right of the = symbol as in 
[propery]="expression". In interpolation syntax, the template 
expression is surrounded by double curly braces.

Ex:
<h3> {{username}},Welocome to Ang</h3>

35) What are template statements?:
-----------------------------------
A template statement responds to an event raised by a binding target
such as an element, component,or directive. The template statements
apper in quotes to the right of the = symbol like(event)="statement"
.Let's take an example of button click event's statement.

Ex:
---
<button (click)="editProfile()">Edit Profile</button>

36) What are pipes?
--------------------

37) What is parameterized pipe?
--------------------------------

38) What is differnce between pure and impure pipe?
----------------------------------------------------
A pure pipe is only called when angular detects a change in the 
value or the parametrs passed to a pipe. For example, any changes
to a primitive input value(String,Number,Boolean,Symbol) or a
changed object reference(Date,Array,Function,Object)

An impure pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter 
whether the value or parameters changes.i.e, An impure pipe is called
often, as often as every keystroke or mouse-move.

39)What is RxJS?
----------------
RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and callback-based
code in a functional, reactive style using observables. Many APIs
such as HttpClient produce and consume RxJS observables and also
uses opearators for processing observables.

import { Observable, throwError } from 'rxjs';
import { catchErrot, retry } from 'rxjs/operators';

40) What are events in angular?
--------------------------------
- ng-click
- ng-copy
- ng-cut
- ng-dblclick
- ng-keydown
- ng-keypress
- ng-mousemove
- ng-mouseup

41) What is differences between promise and observable?
-------------------------------------------------------
As soon as a promise is made, the execution takes place. However
, this is not the case with observables they are lazy. This means
that nothing happens until a subscription is made.

While proises handle a single event, observable is a stream that 
allows passing of more than one event. A call-back is made for
each event in an obsevable.

42) What are the utility functions provided by RxJS?
-----------------------------------------------------
- Converting existing code for async operation into observables
- Iterating through the values in a stream
- Mapping values to different types
- Filtering streams
- Composing multiple streams

43) Explain how custom elements works internally.
---------------------------------------------------
- App registers cusotm element with browser; Use the createCustomElement()
function to convert a component into a class that can be registered with the 
browser as a custom element.

- App adds custom element to DOM; add custom element just like a
built-in HTML element directly into the DOM.

- Browser instantiate component based class; Browser creates an 
instance of the registerd class and adds it to the DOM.

- Instance providers content with data binding and change detection;
The content with in template is rendered using the component and DOM
data.
