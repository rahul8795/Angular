1) What is Angular?
------------------

Front End Development Framework:
---------------------------------
Front-End development is all about the parts of a webiste that users see. Also refered to
as "CSS framework" these are packages containing pre-written, standardized code in files 
and folders. They give you a base to build on while still allowing flexibility with the 
final design. 

Maintained and Developed by Google:
-----------------------------------
Angular JS is a Javascript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by 
Google and by a community of individuals and conrporations to address many of the challenges
encountered in developing single-page applications.It aims to simplify both the development 
and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model-view-
controller(MVC) and model-view-viewmdoel(MVVC) architectures.

Javascript Based:
------------------
Javascript is the language of the web. If you know Javascript. You can talk to your browser
like it is your best friend. Angular is based on Javascript and Typescript (which is a 
superset of Javascript).

Single Page Application:
-------------------------
A single-page application is an app that works inside a browser and does not require page 
reloading use. You are using this typw of applicaitons every day. These are, for instance:
Gmail,Google Maps, Facebook or GitHub.


2) Angular 8: What's New:
--------------------------

IVY Engine:
-----------
Angular Ivy is a next-generation compilation and rendering pipeline, which reduces the 
bundle size, loads faster in slower networks and is simple to use. Ivy is still in an 
experimental phase and is expected to be available in Angular version 8.0.

BEZEL Engine:
-------------
Google open sourced the software responsible for building most of our projects under the 
name Bazel. Bazel is a powerful tool which can keep track of the dependecies between 
different packages and build targets. The coolest features of Bazel is that it has a smart
algorithm for determining the build dependecies.

Differential Loading:
---------------------
Differential loading is process by which the browser choose between modern or lagacy
Javascript based on its own capabilities. We now take advantage of this by default by
performing a modern bulid (es2015) and a lagacy build (es5) of your applicaiton. When
users load your applicatation, they'll automatically get the bundle they need.


3) Project Setup:
------------------
Download nodeJs and npm in our system

NodeJs - It is open-source, cross plateform and Javascript runtime environment that execute
javascript code outside the browser.

4) Writing Our FIrst App:
--------------------------


5) What is Typescript?
-----------------------
Typescript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language. It was designed by Anders
Hejlsberg at Microsoft. Typescript is a superset of Javascript.


6) Integrating External CSS:
-----------------------------
install bootstrap using bellow commond:
>>> npm i --save bootstrap@3
after that to "node_modules" where u will find 'bootstrap.css" file copy file path
then come to "angular.json" file and search 'style' where u put the path

after go to terminal and press  'ctrl+c'  and re-run the program using bellow commond:
>>> npm -o server

7) How an angular app gets loaded?
------------------------------------

8) Components:
---------------
Generating sub component using bellow comonds:

>>> ng generate component SubServer

9) Data Binding:
------------------

10) Event Binding:
-------------------

11) Directives:
----------------

12) Using Built In Directives:
---------------------------------
ngIf
ngFor
ngStyle
ngClass
